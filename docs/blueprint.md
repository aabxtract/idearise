# **App Name**: IdeaRise

## Core Features:

- Idea Submission: Allows users to submit their ideas, which are then stored on-chain. It also initializes the idea's weight to zero and saves the author's address.
- Attention Staking: Enables users to stake attention tokens (or other ERC20 tokens) on ideas they find interesting, increasing the idea's weight and updating its ranking in the pool.
- Live Idea Ranking: Continuously updates the ranking of ideas based on their weight, providing a dynamic view of the most popular and engaging ideas.
- Proof of Thought Badges: Automatically awards badges to idea creators based on their idea's weight, providing a gamified incentive for generating impactful ideas. Badges can be stored on-chain or minted as NFTs.
- Idea Pool Dashboard: Displays a grid or list of idea cards with idea text, author, idea weight, stake attention button, and badge status.
- AI-Powered Idea Summarization: Uses generative AI as a tool to provide concise summaries of the top-weighted ideas, making it easier for users to quickly understand the core concepts and value of each idea.
